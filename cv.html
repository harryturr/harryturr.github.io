  <h2>Skills</h2>

  <h3>Programming</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      I have nearly twenty years of programming experience and have
      enjoyed several programming languages, and like learning new
      ones. I take pride in writing, and appreciate reading,
      aesthetically pleasing code.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Java</b> is the language I have most professional
        experience with, and I am quite familiar with its ins and
        outs, as well as several common tools and frameworks, such
        as Maven and Dropwizard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Haskell</b> was used almost exclusively in the Wire
        backend, and I spent the better part of three years learning
        and getting productive in this marvelous programming
        language.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Python</b> is a language I have been revisiting countless
        times during my career, and is my go-to language for smaller
        jobs and prototyping.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rust</b> is becoming one of my favorite languages as I am
        starting to appreciate its expressiveness, zero-cost
        abstractions and rich type system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Common Lisp</b> was my favorite language for a long time,
        and I have worked professionally with it on two occasions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ruby</b> is a language that caught my attention quite
        early, and I used it for writing network management systems
        long before Ruby on Rails was invented.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Perl</b> is the first language I used professionally.
        While I have not used it for a long time, it taught me all I
        know about regular expressions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h3>Operational</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      My first full time position was as a system administrator on
      Solaris, and for the past twenty years I have repeatedly been
      involved in related tasks.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Linux</b> was my desktop operating system for twelve years, and
        I am still using it on a daily basis on the server side. I
        have also been exposed to a number of other Unices, such as
        Solaris, Digital UNIX, FreeBDS, NetBSD and Darwin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>TCP/IP</b> has always been very close to my work, be it
        as a developer of network management systems for large IP
        networks, or cloud network architecture. Besides the
        fundamentals, I am familiar with protocols such as DNS,
        HTTP, SMTP, IMAP4 and GTP.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cloud services</b> is something I have been increasingly
        involved in, in particular AWS. I have deployed services at
        scale using Ansible and Chef, and encoded complex
        environments as code using Terraform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Containerization</b> is a recent topic for me, and lately
        I have been highly involved in operating containers on
        CoreOS/fleet, and the migration to Kubernetes/Calico.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Interests</h2>

  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am fond of cycling, both the athletic and mechanical
        aspects, as well as collecting funny looking bicycles and
        volunteering as a bicycle mechanic at an annual even to
        promote cycling. I also run and practice ju jitsu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being the owner of a garden and greenhouse, I enjoy tending
        it and growing my own vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        I enjoy programming, in particular the functional style, and
        frequently find myself tinkering with code in my spare time.
        I also try to pass on this passion to the next generation by
        volunteering at our local Code Club.
      </li>
      <li>
        I like yeast, consequently I both brew my own beer and bake
        my own bread.
      </li>
    </ul>
