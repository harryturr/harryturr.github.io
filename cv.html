      <h3>Programming</h3>

      <section>
        <p>
          I have several years of programming experience and have
          enjoyed using python, but like learning new
          ones. I appreciate reading,
          aesthetically pleasing code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been using linux as my full time operating system,
          while still experimenting with interesting distros,
          for example NIXOS.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Python</b> is the main language I have been using during my
            graduate studies. It is my go-to language for smaller
            jobs and hacky scripts, but I have also used it to write
            software to operate our open source home-built AFM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>MATHEMATICA</b> is a language that I used mostly during
            my undergraduate degree, but will still use if I need to solve
            systems absolutely and not numerically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Julia</b> is the new language that I have been experimenting
            with, intrigued by the dynamic language that can run at speeds
            of its static counterparts.
          </li>
