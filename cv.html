  <h2>Skills</h2>

  <h3>Programming</h3>

  <section>
    <p>
      I have several years of programming experience and have
      enjoyed using python, but like learning new
      ones. I appreciate reading,
      aesthetically pleasing code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been using linux as my full time operating system,
      while still experimenting with linux on the server side, 
      for example with NIXOS.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Python</b> is the main language I have been using during my
        graduate studies. It is my go-to language for smaller
        jobs and hacky scripts, but I have also used it to write 
        software to operate our open source home built AFM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MATHEMATICA</b> is a language that I used mostly during 
        my undergraduate, but will still use if I need to solve
        systems absolutely and not numerically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Julia</b> is the new language that I have been experimenting
        with, intrigued by the dynamic language that can run at speeds 
        of its static counterparts.
      </li>
    </ul>
